# Synthetic Datasets

This folder contains 80 synthetic atom probe tomography (APT) point cloud datasets in .npy format. These datasets are ideal for testing clustering algorithms and training machine learning models, as they include ground truth labels—eliminating the need for manual annotation.  

Each dataset simulates APT data with varying chromium (Cr) concentrations, background noise levels, and clustering behaviors.

Each .npy file contains a NumPy array of shape (N, 4):  
[x, y, z, label]  
* x, y, z → 3D coordinates
* label → atom type (0 = Fe matrix, 1 = Cr cluster atom, etc.)

## 🔑 Notes  
Data is provided in .npy format for easy loading with Python:  
```python
import numpy as np
data = np.load("Synthetic_1.npy")
print(data.shape)   # (N, 4)
```
